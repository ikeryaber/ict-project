    <ul>
      <li> Project Manager </li>
      <p> The Project Manager owns the overall timeline and ensures the team hits each milestone. They draft and share the team’s work plan, call brief stand‑up meetings at the start of each session, and track progress against the success criteria </p>
      <li> Lead Developer </li>
      <p> The Lead Developer sets up the project repository, defines the folder/file structure, and writes the core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in GitHub. They review and merge teammates’ pull requests, enforce code‑style conventions, and ensure the site runs without errors </p>
      <li> UX/UI Designer </li>
      <p>   The Designer crafts the site’s look and feel: color palette, typography, spacing, navigation flow, and responsive layouts. They produce wireframes or mockups (in Figma or on paper), define accessibility guidelines (contrast ratios, alt‑text conventions), and hand off design assets (icons, images, style sheets) to the Developer </p>
      <li> Content Strategist </li>
      <p> The Content Strategist defines the site’s voice and structure. They write and edit all headings, paragraphs, lists, link text, and alt‑text so that the student’s identity, interests, and values come through. They organize content into logical sections, draft the site outline (About Me, Skills, Projects), and ensure everything aligns with the target audience  </p>
      <li> QA & Documentation Specialist </li>
      <p>   The QA Specialist tests every page on multiple devices and browsers, checks for broken links, validates HTML/CSS against standards, and audits accessibility (keyboard navigation, alt text, color contrast). They log all issues in GitHub as “Issues,” verify fixes, and maintain the process journal: commit summaries, decision logs, and peer‑feedback notes </p>
