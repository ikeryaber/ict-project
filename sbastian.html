    <strong>  sports  </strong>
      <p> I really like sports because, in some way, I find it easier to play them compared to other people. Also, something I like about them is that you have rivals, so you always have to improve because you know there is someone better than you  </p>
     <strong>   gymnastics and football </strong>  
      <p> I used to practice gymnastics, I practiced it for 7 years but after a while, I stopped liking it and it became boring, so I switched to football and that's when I realized that I really enjoyed it there. I've been in that sport for 4 months now and I haven't gotten bored even a little. Even though I'm not the best on my team, I always try to improve a little more. </p>
     <strong>   About me  </strong> 
     <p> A little more about me is that I have 2 sisters, one turns 18 this year and the other is already 23. I also have a 12-year-old brother and 2 cats. I turn exactly 14 on May 21 and was born in 2011. </p>
